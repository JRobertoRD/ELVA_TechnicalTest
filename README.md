- Have the superPosition(strArr) function in python read the array of strings
stored in strArr, which will contain 2 elements, both of which will be a long
string of comma-separated words of some arbitrary length;
-Its objective is that the function returns true if there is at least 1 element in
common in both lists, otherwise the program must return false
